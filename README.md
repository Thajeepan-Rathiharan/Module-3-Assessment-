## About the project

This is the third project in the Front-End Plus course at the Learning People which is a task from the Frontend Mentor. The task is to recreate an e-commerce web page using the resources they gave and I used the knowledge I've gained from the Front-End Plus course with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and recreated the e-commerce product website they have shown on their site (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6) to the best of my ability. 

## Created with

1. Visual Studio Code editor
2. Git source control
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. JavaScript

## Learning outcome

What I have learnt from this project is that it is important to pay attention to what I am typing especially when it comes to making a website that is responsive on more than one platform, as a single spelling error can either not make the function, variable or event work or even the CSS properties to not work. Not only that but I learnt that as a frontend developer it is a must to keep checking the website after a new addition to the code to see that content isn't overlapping and to see if it is functioning as I expected it to in my head when writing the code.
I overcame my problems by watching live solution videos on YouTube for helping me be able to compare my code to theirs and see where I went wrong and fix the issue and by updating my code on two different tabs so I can see where my spelling errors are and fix it immediately.

## Credits

Images for the webpage were given to me by Frontend Mentor, as well as the font-size needed and screen sizes for the webpage. They also provided me with the colour codes for the specific shade of orange. These images can be found in my img folder that contains all the images I used that were given from Frontend Mentor.

I would like to give credit to this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHEjrlHLbno)for being my guidance to helping me realise my errors in my code. 

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the mentors at Learning People for providing me with the knowledge needed to create responsive webpages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as teaching me how to use Git source control to upload files to a GitHub repository and remove the files too.
