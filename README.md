## About the project

This is the third project in the Front-End Plus course at the Learning People which is a task from the Frontend Mentor. The task is to recreate an e-commerce web page using the resources they gave and I used the knowledge I've gained from the Front-End Plus course with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and recreated the e-commerce product website they have shown on their site (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6) to the best of my ability. 

## Created with

1. Visual Studio Code editor
2. Git source control
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. JavaScript

## Credits

Images for the webpage were given to me by Frontend Mentor, as well as the font-size needed and screen sizes for the webpage. They also provided me with the colour codes for the specific shade of orange.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the mentors at Learning People for providing me with the knowledge needed to create responsive webpages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as teaching me how to use Git source control to upload files to a GitHub repository and remove the files too.
